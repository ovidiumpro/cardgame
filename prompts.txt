Triggered Abilities ScriptableObject:
I hope you can still remember the code I posted a few replies back about my CompositeEffect and AtomicEffect. I want to implement triggered abilities in the game. These are basically Composite Effects that would trigger when a certain condition is met. I am representing all cards and creatures logically as CardAsset scriptable objects. I want to add another field here, which would be a list of Triggered Abilities. TriggerAbility would also be a scriptable object, that has a CompositeEffect field, a TriggerCondition scriptable object, and a TriggerType, which would signal on what type of event would the condition be checked, for example when a friendly creature dies, or when a card is added to the stack, or when a card is drawn, etc.
